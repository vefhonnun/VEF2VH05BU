## Official Pico CSS Demonstrations

The official Pico CSS repository and website host various examples that serve as demonstration sites:

* **Pico CSS Preview/Documentation:** The main documentation site often acts as a live preview, demonstrating all the components and base styles (typography, forms, tables, etc.) in both **light and dark modes**. You can see the default, elegant styling applied to standard semantic HTML elements.
    * **Link to Pico CSS Website:** [https://picocss.com/](https://picocss.com/)

    * **Examples Showcase:** [https://picocss.com/examples](https://picocss.com/examples)
    * **Basic Template** / **Preview:** A pure HTML example showing most components. ([Preview link available from the Examples page](https://picocss.com/examples/preview/))
    * **Class-less Preview:** An example using minimal to no classes, highlighting the framework's "semantic HTML" focus. ([Class-less Preview link available from the Examples page](https://picocss.com/examples/classless/))
    * **Integrations:** Examples showing Pico CSS used with technologies like **React** or **Angular**, often including features like color scheme switching and modals.

## Third-Party Examples and Uses

While the official examples are the best place to start, Pico CSS is also used in various real-world and project sites:

* **GitHub Repository:** The main Pico CSS GitHub repository contains the source code and details, and often links to more in-depth examples and community use cases.
    * **Link to Pico CSS GitHub:** [https://github.com/picocss/pico](https://github.com/picocss/pico)
* **Technology Showcase Lists:** Services that track web technology usage will compile lists of sites detected as using Pico CSS, which can offer real-world examples (though these lists may contain false positives or dynamically generated previews).
